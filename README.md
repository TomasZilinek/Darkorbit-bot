# Darkorbit-bot

When I was a child I played the online browser game Darkorbit so out of nostalgy I decided to program a bot for it. It is a simple bot that scans the screen using Image Recognition and then picks up boxes that are all over the map. The program clicks on the creen. It picks up bonus boxes in a defined pattern. It flies away from danger. I left it running over the night and it picked up a lot of the game currency and other stuff without encountering a failure. (made in 2020)
